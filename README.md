# [GNSS (GitHub) Rev. B](https://github.com/FranzImsch/gnss)

# Abstract

[ZED-F9P](https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/ZED-F9P-04B_DataSheet_UBX-21044850.pdf)-based GNSS dev board with [ISM330DHCX]() 6-DoF IMU, [BMM150]() Magnetometer and [DPS310](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-DPS310-DS-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d462576f34750157750826c42242) pressure sensor.

As a basic UI, the OLED (1.5") can be used along with a navigation switch, more advanced usage requires a web interface. The device features a microSD card reader for data logging.

The ESP32 is used as the microcontroller because of its WiFi and Bluetooth capability that enables data to be streamed onto a device (phone, tablet, â€¦) wirelessly.

The component selection is partly influenced by the semiconductor shortage.

```Work in progress!```  
To Do:
- Extensive testing
- Documentation
- Software

# Hardware

## Changelog (Rev A to B)

* Added LiPo battery to enable standalone operation
* Replaced BNO055 with ISM330DHCX and BMM150 due to their superior performance
* Removed SHT40 as the first revision revealed that the board heats up too much for temperature or humidity measurement (Can be added via exposed i2c connector)
* Added USB hub to board
* Protected ZED a bit more against electrical damage (isolating and filtering IO, LDO as power supply)
* many minor improvements
